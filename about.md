My full name's Christopher Miguel Carin. I'm a fourth year Graphic Design student at OCADU. This is my blog where I write nonsense about my Graphic Design Workshop. Other than discord, I don't really use social media so the best way contact me is either that or via e-mail (preferably personal one).

My end goal for this project revolves around building some sort of digital musical instrument on embedded hardware. Currently, I'm trying to do so by working with a [Bela](http://bela.io/) development board.

I like computers and synthesizers and stuff I guess.

# About this Website

This website was built using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) engine. It was designed with the intention of being [minimal in file size](https://tools.pingdom.com/#5f49ba1d42400000) while visually trying to borrow from WEB1.0 aesthetics. The little dude at the top was illustrated using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). I don't really have a name for them yet. They're based off a friend of mine from Calgary who makes some pretty rad music. Their last name sounds like crow, so I drew a crow.

I'm planning to use this blog to keep track of notes, prototypes, ideas, etc. Things I plan on posting include: PureData/MaxMSP patches, random Bela and C++ stuff, badly explained DSP math, and just general nonsense about design, sound, and music. Maybe I'll post some p5.js or processing stuff if it's relevant too.
