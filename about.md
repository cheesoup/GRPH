# About Chrissy

**E-mail**: chr.carin(a)gmail.com\

**Last.fm**: [not_Chiisu](https://www.last.fm/user/not_Chiisu)

My full name's Christopher Miguel Carin. I'm a fourth year Graphic Design student at OCADU. This is my blog where I write nonsense about my Graphic Design Workshop. Other than discord, I don't really use social media so the best way contact me is probably there.

My end goal for this project revolves around building some sort of digital musical instrument on embedded hardware. Currently, I'm trying to do so by working with a [Bela](http://bela.io/) development board. I have a to do list for this project **[here](todo)**.

I like computers and synthesizers and stuff I guess.

# About this Website

This website was created using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is built entirely in HTML5 and CSS3. The layout was hand-coded by myself with the goal of borrowing from WEB 1.0 and retro computing aesthetics while trying to remain both visually and digitally [minimal](https://tools.pingdom.com/#5f51c41051400000). To remain to lightweight, this website avoids the use of javascript, web fonts, and CSS animations while remaining conservative with the amount of images being loaded on a page.

The little bird at the top was illustrated using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). I don't really have a name for them yet. They're based off a friend of mine from Calgary who makes some pretty rad music. Their last name sounds like crow, so I drew a crow.

I'm planning to use this blog to keep track of notes, prototypes, ideas, etc. Things I plan on posting include: PureData/MaxMSP patches, random Bela and C++ stuff, badly explained DSP math, and just general nonsense about design, sound, and music. Maybe I'll post some p5.js or processing stuff if it's relevant too.

# Resources on Digital Audio
Below are some useful links for audio programming information.
- **[Bela Resources](https://learn.bela.io/)**\
  The official wiki for the bela audio cape. I haven't really read through the Supercollider or PureData tutorials on the site, but the C++ tutorial has been really informative when working with the hardware.
- **[Theory and Techniques of Electronic Music](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/)**\
  A useful book written by the guy who created PureData. It contains a lot of informative (but kind of difficult) writing regarding digital audio synthesis from a signal processing perspective. It also contains a fair amount example Pd implementations, many of which are pre-packaged with the programmer's installer.
- **[katja's homepage on sinusoids, complex numbers and modulation](https://www.katjaas.nl/home/home.html)**\
  A blog written featuring a lot of writing on advanced frequency domain processing. It's written by a prominent PureData community member.
- **[MusicDSP](https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/)**\
  A repository of code examples for sound applications. A lot of it is in C++.
- **[The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](https://www.dspguide.com/)**\
  I haven't really read through this completely but there's obviously a lot of good information here about signal processing and the math behind it here. According to a random person on the internet who recommended it to me, it's less math heavy than its name imply.
