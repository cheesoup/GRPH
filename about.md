Hi I'm Chris\
Discord: chrissyæƒ¨#0712\
Last.fm: [not_Chiisu](https://www.last.fm/user/not_Chiisu)\

My full name's Christopher Miguel Carin. I'm a fourth year Graphic Design student at OCADU. This is my blog where I write nonsense about my Graphic Design Workshop. Other than discord, I don't really use social media so the best way contact me is either that or via e-mail (preferably personal one).

My end goal for this project revolves around building some sort of digital musical instrument on embedded hardware. Currently, I'm trying to do so by working with a [Bela](http://bela.io/) development board.

I like computers and synthesizers and stuff I guess.

## about this website

I'm planning to use this blog to keep track of notes/prototypes/ideas/etc. Things I plan on posting include: PureData/MaxMSP patches, random Bela/C++ shit (as I try to figure it out from a Java perspective), badly explained DSP math, and just general nonsense about design, sound, and music. Maybe I'll post some p5.js/processing stuff if it's relevant too.

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The layout was designed by myself. Typefaces used are [DotGothic16](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DotGothic16?query=dotgothic) and [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono?query=ibm). Both are hosted by Google Fonts.
