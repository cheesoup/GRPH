I"Ì<p>Check it out!! Itâ€™s my first post!! How cool is that? Cominâ€™ straight from the 647 to the 905 to the 416 etc. I donâ€™t really have much to write about right now. So I guess Iâ€™ll just some small updates about what Iâ€™ve been up to.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bela.io/">Bela</a> development board for my project finally came in. Above is a picture of it. The developers of the board describe it as â€œan open-source embedded computing platform for creating responsive, real-time interactive systems with audio and sensorsâ€. In laymen terms, essentially itâ€™s single-board computer (think Raspberry Pi) with a programmable cape which specializes in processing signals.</p>

<p>Originally, I was planning on programming the Bela board using PureData. After experimenting a little bit however, I think it might be a better idea to program it in C++. PD patches seem to be a bit heavier on the board in comparison. If I go with the latter route, Iâ€™ll probably stick to PD for prototyping signals paths and such.</p>

<p>Other than experimenting with the board, Iâ€™ve mostly just been spending my time developing this blog. This blog is the first time Iâ€™ve used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for a project. Itâ€™s basically a static site generator that I really wanted try out. Iâ€™m still new to working with this kind of platform, so let me know if you run into any bugs/broken link.</p>
