# Resources on Digital Audio
Below are some useful links for audio programming information.
- [Bela Resources](https://learn.bela.io/)\
  The official wiki for the bela audio cape. I haven't really read through the Supercollider or PureData tutorials on the site, but the C++ tutorial has been really informative when working with the hardware.
- [Theory and Techniques of Electronic Music](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/)\
  A useful book written by the guy who created PureData. It contains a lot of informative (but kinda difficult) writing regarding digital audio synthesis from a signal processing perspective. The book also has quite a few examples of Pd implementations.
- [katja's homepage on sinusoids, complex numbers and modulation](https://www.katjaas.nl/home/home.html)\
  A blog by a prominent PureData user. It features a lot of writing on advanced frequency domain processing.
- [MusicDSP](https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/)\
  A repository of example code specifically for music and sound programming
- [The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](https://www.dspguide.com/)\
  I haven't really read through this completely, but I there's ton of a information on signal processing here.
