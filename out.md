# Resources on Digital Audio
Below are some useful links for audio programming information.
- **[Bela Resources](https://learn.bela.io/)**\
  The official wiki for the bela audio cape. I haven't really read through the Supercollider or PureData tutorials on the site, but the C++ tutorial has been really informative when working with the hardware.
- **[Theory and Techniques of Electronic Music](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/)**\
  A useful book written by the guy who created PureData. It contains a lot of informative (but kind of difficult) writing regarding digital audio synthesis from a signal processing perspective. It also contains a fair amount example Pd implementations, many of which are pre-packaged with the programmer's installer.
- **[katja's homepage on sinusoids, complex numbers and modulation](https://www.katjaas.nl/home/home.html)**\
  A blog written featuring a lot of writing on advanced frequency domain processing. It's written by a prominent PureData community member.
- **[MusicDSP](https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/)**\
  A repository of code examples for sound applications. A lot of it is in C++.
- **[The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](https://www.dspguide.com/)**\
  I haven't really read through this completely but there's obviously a lot of good information here about signal processing and the math behind it here. According to a random person on the internet who recommended it to me, it's less math heavy than its name imply.
