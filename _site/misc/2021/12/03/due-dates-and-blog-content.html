<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I have too much stuff to write about and not enough time. In case I don’t finish, below is list of posts I still have drafted up. You can refer to this list for updates on these unfinished drafts. My goal is get all these up within a week of submission day at least.</p>

<p><strong>Drafts that haven’t been posted yet:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Anatomy of Subtractive Synths Pt. II</li>
  <li>Code Overview: Oscillators</li>
  <li>Code Overview: Delays</li>
</ol>

<p>I don’t think I’m going to be able to write all of the content I would like before Dec. 8th. Unfortunately, I have an essay due for another class on the exact same day. My goal for now is to finish my overview on synth anatomy and then quickly write about the code and design decisions I have finalized. While I do have a functioning synth engine on Bela, a lot of it is still underdeveloped and not exactly ready to be shared. The only things which have been finalized so far are the oscillators, the delay section, and the overall signal path (minus the effects). The latter of these topic doesn’t really require any sort code breakdown to explain thankfully.</p>

<p>I realize now that it’s really hard to describe signal processing related things without falling back on jargon. I guess I take for granted how much I’ve internalized a lot of the terminology I would read about while obsessively researching things. It also doesn’t help that I feel like I struggle with writing in general. Even with this post I’m, constantly editing myself while I write. It’s making it take forever to actually finish. It’s horrible.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t even think the amount content I have right now is bad. It’s just not everything I have to talk about which I feel is a little disappointing. Either way, if I fail to get these posts up by 8th, I think I can at least get them written within the week of. The nice thing about a blog is that it can always updated after the fact.</p>

<p>Anyways, here’s some Sade. If you don’t like this song, your life choices are incorrect.
