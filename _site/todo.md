# To do list

Below is a list of things I still need to do for this project. They're listed in the order I assume I'll get things done in (which isn't strict by any means).

**Implement Modulation**
- Program an LFO class
- Figure out how to implement a modulation matrix

**Implement Effects**
- Distortion/Overdrive
- Chorusing and maybe a phaser?
- Reverb if there's still enough processing power for it (maybe an external unit using the Axoloti instead?)

**Implement MIDI**
- Fix the CC messages to follow the standard
- NRPN controls
- Maybe implement OSC? (Could be useful for laptop/phone connectivity)

**Design an interface**
- Figure out the physical controls to be used
- Design a layout for the interface
- Protoype the interface using breadboards
- Re-design the circuit as a PCB
- Alternatively, create a final version using perf board
- Get the mounting plate cut
- Design a nice container to put everything in

**Design print and presentation stuff**
- POST MOREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
- Figure out some sort of way to showcase the synth
- Manual
- Promotional stuff
- Make a nicer splash page for this site

Jesus christ I have so much work.
