<p>Debugging this site was a lot more of a pain in the ass than I thought it would be. After an extra day of website work, I finally managed to get my Github Pages to recognize my Jekyll source repository as a website. I feel like this should’ve been obvious how to do, but I’m actually pretty unfamiliar with the git protocol.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought you were supposed to simply upload the preview site to your repo. However, after inspecting other people Jekyll repos, I noticed that they had their whole Jekyll project within the repository. This kinda baffled me, but when I tried it, low and behold my site showed up automatically. Unfortunately this wasn’t a perfect process. Uploading my site in such a way resulted in something going wrong with the tagging system.</p>

<p>Apparently Github Pages doesn’t support the <a href="https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging">Jekyll-Tagging</a> plugin. It took me a while to figure this out and I was getting really annoyed about it. Ultimately, I had to look into some liquid code for building a tag clouds. Below are some pages I referenced while trying to fix this issue.</p>

<p>I still need to get the RSS working. I don’t think it’s that important though :p</p>
