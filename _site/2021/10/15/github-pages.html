<p>Debugging this site was a lot more of a pain in the ass than I thought it would be. After an extra day of website work, I finally managed to get my Github Pages to recognize my Jekyll source repository as a website. I feel like this should’ve been obvious how to do, but I’m actually pretty unfamiliar with the git protocol.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought you were supposed to simply upload the preview site to your repo. However, after inspecting other people’s projects, I noticed that they had their whole Jekyll source code within the repository. This kinda baffled me, but when I tried it, low and behold my site showed up automatically. However, uploading my site this resulted in something going wrong with the tagging system.</p>

<p>Apparently Github Pages doesn’t support the jekyll-tagging plugins natively. It took me a while to figure this out and I was getting really annoyed about it. Ultimately, I had to look into some liquid code for building a tag clouds. I guess I’ll post some of the links I found below I case I need them later.</p>

<p>I still need to get the RSS working. I don’t think it’s that important though.</p>
