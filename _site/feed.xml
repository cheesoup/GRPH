After an extra day of website work, I finally managed to get my Github Pages to recognize my Jekyll source repository as a website. I feel like this should’ve been obvious how to do, but I’m actually pretty unfamiliar with the git protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought you were supposed to simply upload the preview site to your repo. However, after inspecting other people Jekyll repos, I noticed that they had their whole Jekyll project within the repository. This kinda baffled me, but when I tried it, low and behold my site showed up automatically. Unfortunately this wasn’t a perfect process. Uploading my site in such a way resulted in something going wrong with the tagging system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently Github Pages doesn’t support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging&quot;&gt;Jekyll-Tagging&lt;/a&gt; plugin. It took me a while to figure this out and I was getting really annoyed about it. Ultimately, I had to look into some liquid code for building a tag clouds. Below are some pages I referenced while trying to fix this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to get the RSS working.

It’s my first post!! How cool is that? Comin’ straight from the 647 to the 905 to the 416 etc. I don’t really have much to write about right now. So I guess I’ll just some small updates about what I’ve been up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/GRPH/assets/images/bela0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bela&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bela.io/&quot;&gt;Bela&lt;/a&gt; development board for my project finally came in. Above is a picture of it. The developers of the board describe it as “an open-source embedded computing platform for creating responsive, real-time interactive systems with audio and sensors”. In laymen terms, essentially it’s single-board computer (think Raspberry Pi) with a programmable cape which specializes in processing signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I was planning on programming the Bela board using PureData. After experimenting a little bit however, I think it might be a better idea to program it in C++. PD patches seem to be a bit heavier on the board in comparison. If I go with the latter route, I’ll probably stick to PD for prototyping signals paths and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than experimenting with the board, I’ve mostly just been spending my time developing this blog. This blog is the first time I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; for a project. It’s basically a static site generator that I really wanted try out. I’m still new to working with this kind of platform, so let me know if you run into any bugs/broken link.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Updates" /><category term="Blog Stuff" /><summary type="html">Check it out!!
