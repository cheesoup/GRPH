Reality's been pretty rough these last couple days.

My partner's mother passed away a couple days ago (Rest in peace Ana Ghansiam). They've been taking it pretty well I think. On my side, I've just been trying my best to be there. Between viewings and trying to spend as much time as I can with my partner, I've been a little pre-occupied to say the least. Before I could even visit, I had to bust 5 all nighters in a row just to get my work done and it was fucking frustrating.

On the academic front, they're pushing back the starting day of the Winter Term after telling the whole school they need to move back Toronto to attend in-person class. Like holy crap what a shit show.

Anyways, I think the I can finally manage sometime to work and my workshop project again so maybe expect some posts in coming days or so.

I love you all.\
Chris
