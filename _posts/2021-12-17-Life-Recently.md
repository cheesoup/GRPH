Reality's been pretty rough these last couple days.

My partner's mother passed away a couple days ago (rest in peace Ana Ghansiam). They've been taking it pretty well I think. Between viewings and trying to spend as much time as I can with my partner, I've been a little pre-occupied to say the least. Before I could even visit, I had to bust 5 all nighters in a row just to get my work done and it was fucking frustrating. Things are starting to slowdown again, but right now my focus is really on my partner's well-being. In most circumstances, they're extremely helpful when it comes to these sort of DIY electronic projects. Beyond emotional support, they're actually pretty good at programming and know more about basic electronics than I do. Right now though, I think they need sometime to digest everything first.

Hopefully I can find sometime to squeeze work in there, but I might end up having to take it slower than I initially expected. Beyond the their mother's passing, I feel like I haven't been able to spend as much time with them in general. I've just been super focused on this project I guess.

I love you all.\
Chris
