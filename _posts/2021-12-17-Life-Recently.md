Reality's been pretty rough these last couple days.

My partner's mother passed away a couple days ago. They've been taking it pretty well I think. On my side, I've just been trying my best to be there. Between viewings and trying to spend as much time as I can with my partner, I've been a little per-occupied to say the least. Before I could go visit my partner, I had to bust 5 all nighters in a row just to get my work done and it was fucking frustrating.

I think the I can finally manage sometime to work and my workshop project again so maybe expect some posts in coming days or so.

Rest in peace Ana Ghansiam.

I love you all.\
Chris
