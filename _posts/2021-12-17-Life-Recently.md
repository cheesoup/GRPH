Reality's been pretty rough these last couple days.

My partner's mother passed away a couple days ago (rest in peace Ana Ghansiam). They've been taking it pretty well I think. Between viewings and trying to spend as much time as I can with my partner, I've been a little pre-occupied to say the least. Before I could even visit, I had to bust 5 all nighters in a row just to get my work done and it was fucking frustrating. Things are starting to slowdown again, but right now my focus is really on my partner's well-being. Hopefully I can find sometime to squeeze work in there, but I might end up having to take it slower than I initially expected.

I love you all.\
Chris
