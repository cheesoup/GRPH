I just realized I had no actual footage of my sound engine on this blog. I guess better late than never. The overall signal path is still subject to change but most of the oscillator features are more or less finalized at this point. It may take a few posts to fully go over how just the oscillators work. The source code for the engine can be found [here](https://github.com/cheesoup/CheeseVA).
