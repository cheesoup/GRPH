Here's an old video of reverb I actually wanted to re-implement for my project. Unfortunately, when I tried porting it over, I kept getting out of memory issues. This leads me to believe that the Bela in capable of running this algorithm and my project simultaneously. I thought I'd post here anyways because I think it's kind of shame. I really like this reverb.
