Here's an old video of a reverb I programmed over a year ago based on a design by [Jon Dattorro](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart1.pdf).  I really wanted to re-create this for my current project, but unfortunately when I tried porting it over I kept running into memory issues. This leads me to believe that the Bela is incapable of running this algorithm and my project simultaneously. I thought I'd post it here anyways because I think it's kind of shame. I really like this reverb. I think in consolation I may just use the [Axoloti Core](http://www.axoloti.com/product/axoloti-core/) as reverb instead just for presentation.
