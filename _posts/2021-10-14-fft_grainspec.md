My main goal with this patch was to experiment with IFFT synthesis in context of a sample based granular synthesizers. It uses Miller Puckette's [phase vocoder example](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/node182.html) in conjunction with Scott "Acriel" Nordlund's example of [frequency domain filtering](https://acreil.wordpress.com/2020/01/13/pure-data-frequency-domain-filtering-patch/).
