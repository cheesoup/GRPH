I'm hoping to use this thing as a dedicated access point for the Bela. From what I read [here](https://tai-studio.org/2017/08/06/wifi-on-bela-boards.html) it shouldn't be too hard of a process. Ideally I'd like to avoid using the school network for this project as I feel like it's just going to end up in needless headaches.

Also please ignore how messy my room is.
