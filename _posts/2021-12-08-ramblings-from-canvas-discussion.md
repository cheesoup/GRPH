(This is a re-post of what I wrote in discussion board thread. I just wanted to put it here too.)

Even though we're a school of creative individuals, most of what we know about visual design is tied to a single environment: the Adobe Creative Suite. Though our classes tend to focus on the broader concepts that can be applied to design, I've always been annoyed by the lack of an alternative software system available to us. Even when I first registered at OCAD, immediately they strongly suggest that I needed a Mac. But why? Wouldn't it be better if the creative industry actually had diversity in software? How are we supposed to move away from Adobe when ya'll don't even wanna learn Windows?

To contrast this lack of choice, I want to talk about what I admired so much about the late 90s to early 2000s internet. Despite the gaudy GIFs, lack of hierarchy and overuse of marquee, the internet back then was at least a place of individuality. With services like Geocities, Freewebs, Tripod, Angelfire, etc, it felt like you owned this tiny piece real estate to say whatever you want, however you want (with ToS of course). It was glorious as it was hideous. That's pretty much all gone now. It went away when the empires of social media came around to homogenize how we represent ourselves digitally.

What I found refreshing about working with audio was the amount options I had when it came to software. While not a perfect software economy (Pro Tools, Logic, and Cubase are still industry standards money sinks), there seemed to be software available no matter what the budget. Even if I didn't wanna pay for the most expensive thing, there were people (Links to an external site.) out there making fantastic music (Links to an external site.) with free software (Links to an external site.) alone. On top of that, the use of these alternative systems for music creation and the idiosyncrasies that come with them seemed valorised. As Warren Burt puts it, "A machine with its own idiosyncrasies cannot help but have a unique sound" (p. 29-30 (Links to an external site.)).

To me, building a synthesizer is really about being unique. It's about making my own tools out from lowest-level processes I can manage to make things that are distinctly me. Also, I just kind of want to. I like synths and I enjoy learning about them and how they're designed.
