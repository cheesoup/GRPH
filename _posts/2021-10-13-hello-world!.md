Check it out!! It's my first post!! How cool is that? Comin' straight from the 647 to the 905 to the 416 etc. I don't really have much to write about right now. So I guess I'll just some small updates about what I've been up to.

![Bela]({{ "/assets/images/bela0.jpg" | relative_url }})

The [Bela](https://bela.io/) development board for my project finally came in. Above is a picture of it. The developers of the board describe it as "an open-source embedded computing platform for creating responsive, real-time interactive systems with audio and sensors". In laymen terms, essentially it's single-board computer (think Raspberry Pi) with a programmable cape which specializes in processing signals.

Originally, I was planning on programming the Bela board using PureData. After experimenting a little bit however, I think it might be a better idea to program it in C++. PD patches seem to be a bit heavier on the board in comparison. If I go with the latter route, I'll probably stick to PD for prototyping signals paths and such.

Other than experimenting with the board, I've mostly just been spending my time developing this blog. This blog is the first time I've used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a project. It's basically a static site generator that I really wanted try out. I'm still new to working with this kind of platform, so let me know if you run into any bugs/broken link.
